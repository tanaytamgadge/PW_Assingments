        "QUE 1. Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming\n",
        "Python is one of the most popular programming languages because of its versatility, ease of use, and readability. Some of the key features that make Python a popular choice are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Easy Syntax: Python has a clean and readable syntax which reduces the learning curve for beginners.\n",
        "2. Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.\n",
        "3. Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create and manage objects efficiently.\n",
        "4. Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python has an extensive collection of libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow) for a wide variety of tasks, from web development to machine learning.\n",
        "5. Portability: Python is platform-independent, meaning you can run Python code on any operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS).\n",
        "6. Dynamic Typing: Python does not require you to declare the type of variables, making coding faster and simpler.\n",
        "7. Automatic Memory Management: Python handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically, reducing memory leaks and errors.\n",
        "8. Community Support: Python has a large and active community which provides support and contributes to improving the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "QUE 2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
        "Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes. These keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Keywords:\n",
        "- if, else, elif: Used for conditional statements.\n",
        "- for, while: Used for looping.\n",
        "- def: Used to define a function.\n",
        "- return: Used to return a value from a function.\n",
        "- class: Used to define a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def check_number(n):\n",
        "    if n > 0:\n",
        "        return \"Positive\"\n",
        "    elif n < 0:\n",
        "        return \"Negative\"\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        return \"Zero\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(check_number(5))  # Output: Positive\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this program, keywords like `def`, `if`, `elif`, and `else` are used to define the function and control flow.\n",

        "\n",
        "QUE 3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples\n",
        "Mutable vs Immutable Objects in Python\n",
        "In Python, objects are classified into two types based on whether their content can be changed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mutable Objects: These are objects whose value can be changed after they are created.\n",
        "   - Examples: Lists, dictionaries, sets.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   my_list.append(4)\n",
        "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Immutable Objects: These are objects whose value cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
        "   - Examples: Integers, strings, tuples.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "   # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This would raise an error as tuples are immutable.\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparison:\n",
        "- Mutable objects can be altered, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "- Mutable objects are often used when you need to modify data, while immutable objects provide a layer of safety by preventing accidental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "QUE 4. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples\n",
        "Type casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another. This can be useful when you need to perform operations on incompatible data types. Python provides built-in functions to perform type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Type Casting:\n",
        "Explicit Type Casting: Done using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), etc.\n",
        "Implicit Type Casting: Python automatically converts one data type to another without the need for explicit instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "1. int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n",
        "2. float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.\n",
        "3. str(): Converts a value to a string.\n",
        "4. list(): Converts a value to a list.\n",

        "\n",
        "QUE 5. Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used\n",
        "Python provides various operators for different operations like arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.\n",

        "Types of Operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations.\n",
        "   - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (exponentiation), `//` (floor division)\n",

        "     ```python\n",
        "     x = 10\n",
        "     y = 3\n",
        "     print(x + y)  # Output: 13\n",
        "     print(x ** y)  # Output: 1000 (10 raised to the power of 3)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Comparison (Relational) Operators: Compare two values and return `True` or `False`.\n",
        "   - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     a = 5\n",
        "     b = 10\n",

        "     print(a != b)  # Output: True\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "QUE 6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples\n",
        "Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for condition-based logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example 1: Basic `if-else` Statement\n",
