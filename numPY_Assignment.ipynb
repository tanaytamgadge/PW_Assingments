        " 1. Purpose and Advantages of NumPy\n",
        "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for numerical and scientific computing that offers powerful support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Key advantages include:\n",
        "   - Efficient Array Operations: NumPy arrays (ndarrays) are optimized for numerical computation, using less memory and allowing for faster array manipulations compared to Python lists.\n",
        "   - Broad Functionality: It provides numerous functions for linear algebra, statistical operations, Fourier transforms, and more, supporting complex calculations with fewer lines of code.\n",
        "   - Interoperability: It integrates easily with other libraries in Python, like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, extending its functionality into data science and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy enhances Python’s capabilities by providing these efficient data structures, specialized functions, and methods for handling large datasets with optimized performance, which is essential for scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Comparing `np.mean()` and `np.average()`\n",
        "- `np.mean()`: Computes the arithmetic mean of an array along the specified axis. It treats all values equally without applying weights.\n",
        "- `np.average()`: Computes the weighted average if weights are specified. If no weights are given, it works similarly to `np.mean()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "   - Use `np.mean()` when you want a simple average.\n",
        "   - Use `np.average()` when specific values in the array carry more importance than others (e.g., averaging grades with credit weights).\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Reversing a NumPy Array\n",
        "- 1D Array: Use `[::-1]` slicing.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
        "   reversed_arr = arr[::-1]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "- 2D Array:\n",
        "   - To reverse rows: `arr[::-1, :]`\n",
        "   - To reverse columns: `arr[:, ::-1]`\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
        "   reversed_rows = arr[::-1, :]\n",
        "   reversed_columns = arr[:, ::-1]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. Determining Data Types in a NumPy Array\n",
        "   - Use `arr.dtype` to check the data type of elements.\n",
        "   - Importance: Data types determine how much memory is allocated and how quickly calculations can be performed. Choosing the correct data type improves memory efficiency and processing speed, especially with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. Defining `ndarrays` and Differences from Python Lists\n",
        "   - ndarrays: NumPy’s primary data structure, an N-dimensional array, supports efficient storage and manipulation of homogeneous data (elements of the same type).\n",
        "   - Key Features:\n",
        "      - Fixed size and data type.\n",
        "      - Superior computational speed and memory usage for numerical data.\n",
        "      - Broadcasted operations for element-wise computations.\n",
        "   - Differences from Lists:\n",
        "      - Arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, enabling faster computations, while lists are stored as a sequence of references.\n",
        "      - Operations on ndarrays are vectorized, reducing the need for explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Performance Benefits of NumPy Arrays over Python Lists\n",
        "   - NumPy arrays are faster for large-scale operations because they are stored in contiguous memory blocks, reducing memory usage and cache inefficiency.\n",
        "   - NumPy leverages vectorized operations, allowing computations on entire arrays simultaneously rather than element-by-element, drastically improving speed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. Comparing `vstack()` and `hstack()`\n",
        "   - `vstack()`: Stacks arrays vertically (along the rows).\n",
        "   - `hstack()`: Stacks arrays horizontally (along the columns).\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
        "   arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
        "   vertical_stack = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))\n",
        "   horizontal_stack = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. Differences Between `fliplr()` and `flipud()`\n",
        "   - `fliplr()`: Flips the array left to right (horizontally).\n",
        "   - `flipud()`: Flips the array upside down (vertically).\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
        "   flipped_lr = np.fliplr(arr)\n",
        "   flipped_ud = np.flipud(arr)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. Functionality of `array_split()` in NumPy\n",
        "   - `array_split()`: Divides an array into specified parts and handles uneven splits by making the last sub-array smaller if needed.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
        "   split_arr = np.array_split(arr, 3)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. Vectorization and Broadcasting in NumPy\n",
        "   - Vectorization: Enables performing operations on entire arrays without loops, speeding up computations.\n",
        "   - Broadcasting: Allows operations on arrays of different shapes by expanding smaller arrays along dimensions to match the larger array’s shape.\n",
        "  \n",
        "These features enable efficient computations on large datasets, key for tasks like data analysis and scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "practical questions with NumPy:\n",
